# Less_test_stm32f103_cmsis
Development and testing of software code on stm32f103xx microcontroller using CMSIS.
This repository uses a test board Blue Pill based on STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.
A standard software environment is used for code development and testing STMCubeIDE(https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html),from the company STMicroelectronics(https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html).
The ST-LINK utility is used for firmware Utility(https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).
In the examples (code), the peripherals of this microcontroller are tested.
